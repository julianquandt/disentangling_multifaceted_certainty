This folder will contain fitted models once they are initially produced by setting fit_models = TRUE in the setup code chunk of 00_manuscript_jepg.Rmd.

The models are numbered and have respective code files with the same number that fit the models in the model_fits folder.

The model fits are all called the manuscript files, and are numbered in order of their appearance in the manuscript, and afterwards the supplemental materials. 
The numbers should allow to identify which model is used for which claims in the manuscript, by inspecting the respective model loading code chunk in the manuscript files.
